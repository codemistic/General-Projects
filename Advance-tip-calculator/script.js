/*
ðŸŒŸ APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use ðŸ‘‡
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
*/

// Get global access to all inputs / divs here (you'll need them later ðŸ˜˜)
// bill input, tip input, number of people div, and per person total div



// Get number of people from number of people div


// ** Calculate the total bill per person **
const calculateBill = (num) => {
  // get bill from user input & convert it into a number
   let Bill = Number(document.getElementById('billTotalInput').value)

  // get the tip from user & convert it into a percentage (divide by 100)
  let tipPercentage = Number(document.getElementById('tipInput').value)/100

  // get the total tip amount
  let tipAmount = tipPercentage * Bill

  // calculate the total (tip amount + bill)
  let total = parseFloat(Bill + tipAmount).toFixed(2);
  let t = '$'+total
  // calculate the per person total (total divided by number of people)

  let f = '$'+finalTotal 
if(num > 1){
  document.getElementById('perPersonTotal').innerHTML = f
}else{

    count++

  // update the DOM with the new number of people

  // guard clause
  // if amount is 1 or less simply return
  // (a.k.a you can't decrease the number of people to 0 or negative!)
