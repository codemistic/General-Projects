# Text_Editor
I have created a Text editor using Python's Tkinter library. 
This text editor also contain an pre created exe file you can simply copy it and run it on your desktop.
I have also added code with it.
This coding do not contain any object oriented programming it is simply programmed through procedural programming.
Easiely understandable program.
This Text editor is advanced than Notepad as it can also find and replace a specific text entered by user.
Also it contains user friendly UI design so there is no need of programming understanding to use its  exe file.
